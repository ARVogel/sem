        <h1>Robotic Process Automation</h1>
        <p>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology utilized by many corporations to reduce the number of mundane tasks performed by their employees. This provides the business with cost savings and employees with more meaningful work to perform.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Some sample processes that might be good candidates for RPA include processing online orders, uploading documentation to a system for audit purposes, and performing standardized tasks around employees entering or leaving a company.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This website will help provide some RPA examples and walk you through the process of identifying, designing, architecting, building, and supporting these types of automations.</p>
